<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Personal Information</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I grew up in the state of Punjab in northern India and moved to Australia in 2016. I graduated from Melton Secondary College in 2020. I am fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, and English. I can get very motivated and very lazy depending on my mood. My hobbies are sketching, soccer and listening to music.

<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I got an interested in technology when I was around 10 years old, when my father bought me a Tetris game. Playing that game, I started to wonder that how it was possible to show shapes on a screen moving and interacting. Fascinated by the game I grew more interested in games and have continued to play games. In high school I learned coding and it answered many of my questions, so I decided to learn more about IT.
<br>I choose to come to RMIT because it is one of the best universities when it comes to technology and my friends also decided to go to RMIT.
<br>I find it exciting to create programs which can save everyone’s time and do tasks more efficiently than humans. I was always interested in games, so I want to learn about how computers do amazing things in such little times and understand the very basics of how a computer operates.

<br>I want to become an ethical hacker because I find it exciting to breach a software’s security by attacking weaknesses and then come up with measures to make the software more secure. Hackers need to learn a range of programming languages and have strong SQL skills. The payrate for hackers in good and they can work internationally very easily. Being a hacker means always improving your skills. Hackers frequently practice in virtual environments and must learn many languages.
<br>I don’t have much knowledge about coding in various languages and I wish to learn as much as possible before graduating.

<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Project Ideas</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I want to create a chess game with an AI ranging in difficulty. The AI will be capable of calculating several moves it and its opponent can take and figure out the best possible course to take. It will also have adaptive qualities for cases when something doesn’t go as planned. I want to create a 3D chess game, but that's something I will need to work hard on because I've never done any 3D animation before. The game will also have a Player Vs Player mode where two players can play on the same computer. I will use c++ to create this game because it is what is used to create most of the games nowadays and 3D animation can be done efficiently using this language.

<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Personality Profile</h1>

<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">The results didn’t shock me at all. I am a little assertive and I follow my feelings and I am very active and intuitive. Seeing the results makes me worry that I may be selfish at times without realising. In a team project I may assert my own ideas over others’, which is not nice. So I am going to be more patient and listen to what everyone says and won’t make any hasty decisions.
